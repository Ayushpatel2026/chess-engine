## Chess Engine

This chess engine is a Java-based application that leverages Java Swing utilities to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). It has allowed me to practically apply object-oriented programming concepts learned in class and showcases a minimax algorithm for move calculations.

## Features

- **Configurable Game Setup:** Users can customize the game settings to their preferences (as seen below).
- **Search Depth Configuration:** Allows users to specify the depth of the computer's move calculations.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Utilizes the minimax algorithm to compute optimal moves for the computer player.

## How to Run the Chess Engine

1. **Install Java:**
   - Make sure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Java website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Download the `ChessEngine.jar` file from the [link here](build/chess-engine.jar).
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the JAR file.
   - Run the application by double-clicking on the executable JAR file or by using the command:
     ```bash
     java -jar chess-engine.jar
     ```
## Future Enhancements

1. **Code Quality Improvement:** Refactor the code to enhance readability and reduce technical debt.
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Develop and complete test cases to ensure robust functionality and reliability.
3. **Algorithm Optimization:** Enhance the performance of the minimax algorithm by implementing alpha-beta pruning.
4. **Web Version Development:** Transform the chess engine into a web application where users can play chess against each other.
